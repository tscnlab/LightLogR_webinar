# Welcome to the LightLogR Course Series

Build open, reproducible analyses of wearable light exposure and visual experience data in R. Choose the track that fits your background and goals, then follow along with live, hands‑on examples.

## Choose your track

*Live* tutorials run a self‑contained version of R in your browser - no setup required - with only minor functional limitations. *Static* tutorials provide the complete script exactly as you would run it in a local R installation.

## What you’ll do

- Walk through the LightLogR workflow: import → (pre-)processing → visualisation → metrics.
- Sense‑check data quickly with tidy, reproducible steps and overview plots.
- Handle common issues (gaps, irregular sampling, zero inflation) with principled defaults.
- Add photoperiod information and derive interpretable summaries.

For more information on the two tracks, have a look at the [course flyer](assets/Online_course_series_2025-26.pdf)

## How do I get started?

The tutorials are open to give them a go at any time. Try the *live* tutorials to forego any setup, or download the scripts from the *static* tutorials alongside the data from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tscnlab/LightLogR_webinar) for the full experience.

We are also offering free, regular webinars on the topic of *Open and reproducible analysis of light exposure and visual experience data* using `LightLogR.
