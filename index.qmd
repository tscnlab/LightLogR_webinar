# Welcome to the LightLogR Course Series

Build open, reproducible analyses of wearable light exposure and visual experience data in R. Choose the track that fits your background and goals, then follow along with live, hands‑on examples.

## Choose your track

[Beginner Track](beginner.qmd){.btn .btn-primary}
[Advanced Track (to come)](){.btn .btn-secondary}

## What you’ll do

- Walk through the LightLogR workflow: import → (pre-)processing → metrics → visualisation.
- Sense‑check data quickly with tidy, reproducible steps and overview plots.
- Handle common issues (gaps, irregular sampling, zero inflation) with principled defaults.
- Add photoperiod information and derive interpretable summaries.

For more information on the two tracks, have a look at the [course flyer](assets/Online_course_series_2025-26.pdf)
